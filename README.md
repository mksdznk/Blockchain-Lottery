## Blockchain Lottery

**This is a project I made as my Capstone project for the web3 bootcamp I attended at Metana.**

The project is a lottery which runs on the ETH blockchain using smart contracts. The smart contracts are included in the **contracts** directory which is in the root directory, and the FE of the app is included within the directory **blockchain-lottery**, also within the root directory.
